🤖 Holistic Student Support Chatbot

The Holistic Student Support Chatbot is an AI-driven assistant designed to provide emotional and academic support to students through intelligent, empathetic conversations. It uses natural language processing and sentiment analysis to understand user inputs, identify their emotional state, and deliver helpful, context-aware responses.

This is an ongoing project with the goal of developing a full-featured web application that students can rely on for daily guidance, motivation, and support.
